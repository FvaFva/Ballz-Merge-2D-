  _rules:
  - If you push a block into another with the same number, they will be destroyed.
  - When you receive a volume it is placed in your inventory and is not used until
    you transfer it to the cage.
  - The cage's volumes are activated in turn for each hit on the block.
  - If a block with a red glow spawns, then after each wave spawns, it increases
    the number of a random other block.
  - If blocks are connected by a line, they exchange all influences.
  - You can drag and drop volumes around the cage.
  - If the block crosses the lower border, you lose.
